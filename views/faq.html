                            <p>Per IRS regulations, certain expenses associated with your trip are not considered business expenses and will be added as taxable income to you. Examples of these expenses are gifts you or your guest receive, the cost of the various hotel activities you select, and the cost of renting your formal wear. The value of these expenses will be added to your paycheck as taxable gross income in April, 2015. You will also receive a bonus equal to 75% of the taxable gross amount to help offset the additional tax liability you will incur.
